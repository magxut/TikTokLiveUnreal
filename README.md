# TikTokLiveUnreal
This is an unofficial API, which is a rewrite of [TikTokLive](https://github.com/isaackogan/TikTokLive)! Written in C++ and exposed to blueprints. 
With this API you can connect to any TikTok livestream and fetch all data available to users in a stream using just a creator's @username.
